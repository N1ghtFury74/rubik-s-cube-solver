# Original Rubik's Cube Solver Code

This folder contains the original code that was successfully used to build the 900 EGP Rubik's cube solving robot in 2022.

## Original Files
- `Final code + rev mode.py` - Original Python GUI and solver logic
- `Rubiks_code.ino` - Original Arduino controller code
- `tempCodeRunnerFile.py` - Development snippets

## Performance Achieved
- ✅ 10-12 second solve times
- ✅ 100% reliability
- ✅ 900 EGP total budget
- ✅ Successful demonstration (see Facebook video)

## Migration Notes
The original code has been refactored into a professional structure while preserving all core logic:

### Key Improvements Made:
1. **Modular Architecture**: Separated GUI, solver, and communication
2. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive exception management
3. **Logging**: Detailed operation tracking
4. **Configuration**: Centralized settings management
5. **Documentation**: Professional README and API reference
6. **Testing**: Unit tests for reliability
7. **Code Quality**: PEP 8 compliance and best practices

### Original Logic Preserved:
- ✅ Exact same Kociemba algorithm implementation
- ✅ Identical Arduino stepper motor control
- ✅ Same serial communication protocol
- ✅ Preserved color mapping and GUI workflow
- ✅ Maintained move reversal functionality

The refactored code maintains 100% compatibility with the original hardware while providing a much more maintainable and professional codebase.
